University of Southampton coursework project. Developed in around 2 weeks with Istvan Zeno Hevesi for COMP3218.

I designed an implemented some of the major systems:
* Robust interactive dialogue system
* Branching narrative system
* Obstacle aware-AI ships
I also created the scripts and all of the art for the project. Including generative sprites using [Processing](https://processing.org/).
