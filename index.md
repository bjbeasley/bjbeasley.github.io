University of Southampton coursework project. Developed in around 2 weeks with Istvan Zeno Hevesi for COMP3218.

I designed and implemented some of the major systems:
* Robust interactive dialogue system
* Branching narrative system
* Obstacle aware-AI ships

I also created the text and all of the graphics and art for the project. Including generative sprites made with [Processing](https://processing.org/).

University of Southampton coursework project. Developed in around 2 weeks with Daniel Best for COMP3218.

Key Developments:
* A system for rewinding time and the world around the player
 * Enemy AI that can be rewound to any point and resume what it was doing.
 * Efficiently logging data by only storing changes that cannot be interpolated.

## Experimenting with World Map Generation

<img src="images/map.png?raw=true"/>

I developed a library for procedurally generating fantasy world maps.
* Uses a simplified tectonic model
* Fast enough to be used at runtime on mobile devices
* Spherical (mathematically cylindrical, but it accounts for map projection)

I provided additional programming work for this PS4 PlayLink quiz game at [Second Impact Games](https://www.secondimpactgames.com/).

I helped work on the AR face detection system for the mobile companion app. And also helped with a couple of smaller projects while I was there.
